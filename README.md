# iOS OSS (Open Source Software) Licenses 
If you are developing an iOS app, it will be a norm that you are using at least one open source library or two (or hundreds). Well! who is gonna reinvent the wheel? 

So at some point, you may encouter a situation that u need to attribute all open sources being using in the project. For example, Instagram has a whole section for that purpose Profile > Settings > About (same for serveral big apps)

## Prerequisite
Make sure `Python 3` is installed on your machine. if not, [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

## How-to
```
$ python3 getlicense.py -p path/to/your/ios/project
```
`-p`: the path to your project root, where the `Podfile` file is located. 

## It doesn't work for you? 
Haha I'm sure it's not working for everybody. **So what's next?**

**DIY** There is hint in the code, i believe so (\*serious voice\*)
